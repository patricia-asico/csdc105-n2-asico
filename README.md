## What is this about?
This is a repository of all my exercises, labs, and other activities in **CSDC105** *Trends in Application Development*

## What software/application is very much needed in the world today?
Personally I find softwares that optimizes or improves your pc's performance such as  ccleaner to be really useful and helpful especially in decluttering and removing junk files.
Programs are constantly running in the background and unecessary and unwanted files are slowing the pc's performance and having softwares like these manage these problems. It also minimizes the risk of someone recovering deleted files because softwares like this permanently deletes the files.
